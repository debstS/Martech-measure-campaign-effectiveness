# Summary of the project

### Context:
The presentation analyzes the effectiveness of four marketing campaigns related to promoting a Robot Operating System (ROS) whitepaper. The goal was to evaluate campaign performance, identify areas for improvement, and recommend strategies to enhance future campaign planning and ROI. Three datasets were used to assess campaign metrics, including page views, leads, and conversions.

### Approach"
Data Preprocessing:

- Handled missing data (ranging from 1% to 80%) and standardized the dataset to 2,507 rows with 14 columns.
- Segmented and cleaned data for insights into campaign performance and audience engagement.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

* Examined metrics such as page views, bounce rates, average time spent, and lead statuses.
* Campaigns were ranked based on their ability to generate page views, leads, and conversions.

### Statistical Testing:

* Evaluated engagement metrics like bounce rates and lead quality indicators (conversion rates).
* Benchmarked campaigns by performance, identifying top-performing campaigns and those needing improvement.

### Findings

Top Performer:

* Campaign C3 ("CY21_IOT_Robotics_T1_WP_ROSDocker") led in page views (37,122) and total leads (1,539), despite a high bounce rate (79%).


### Areas for Improvement:

* High bounce rates across campaigns (49â€“79%) suggest low user engagement.
* Many disqualified leads indicate inefficiencies in targeting strategies.
* Missing source data hindered the identification of the most effective channels.

### Seasonality Insights:

* November and December showed peak performance, while May, July, and August were slower.
* Weekends and specific weekdays (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) had higher lead activity.

### Lead Demographics:

* Professions like engineers and students contributed the most leads.
* Top-performing countries included China, the US, and India.

### Outcome

Recommendations:

* Improve UI/UX to reduce bounce rates.
* Prioritize disqualified leads for retargeting.
* Gather additional data on campaign costs and customer lifetime value to refine ROI calculations.
* Focus on cross-testing and statistical analysis to pinpoint impactful metrics for performance.

### Impact:

* Established clear performance benchmarks for future campaigns.
* Identified actionable insights to enhance lead conversion and campaign efficiency.
